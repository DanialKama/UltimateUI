## How To Setup
To set up this plugin correctly, make sure that Common UI Plugin is enabled then download and add this plugin to the Plugins folder of your project, and then please follow the [Common UI Quickstart Guide](https://docs.unrealengine.com/5.0/en-US/common-ui-quickstart-guide-for-unreal-engine).  
Instead of creating new classes to handle input actions, you can use the data table and classes that come with this plugin.
