# Ultimate UI Plugin
If you are looking for an easy to setup UI system for your game, this plugin is here to help you.  
This plugin contains most of the default menu and elements that are used in a single-player game.
Don't worry about the performance, all the widgets and their elements are optimized, and all the menus work with the gamepad.  
You can learn more about how each widget and system works by reading comments and notes in each blueprint class.
## How To Setup
To set up this plugin correctly, please follow the [Common UI Quickstart Guide](https://docs.unrealengine.com/5.0/en-US/common-ui-quickstart-guide-for-unreal-engine).  
Instead of creating new classes to handle input actions, you can use the data table and classes that come with this plugin.
